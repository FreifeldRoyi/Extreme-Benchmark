# Extreme-Benchmark
Simple benchmark for different programming languages and platforms

## TEST case
1. GET a http request to the tested server
2. Perform a GET request to a remote website (e.g Google)
3. Return a response
4. Measure requests per seconds

## Rules
1. This is a gentelmen's bet! We help each other get the best results (although we prefer one framework/language over the other)
2. This will be an iterative process. Once we are satisfied with the results add a suitable git tag. See description in _TAGS_ section
3. Keep everything organized! Each improvement should be committed to GITHUB. Each excercise should have its own folder

## Tests descriptions
